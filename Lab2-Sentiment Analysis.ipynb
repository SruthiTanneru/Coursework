    "Bag of words model represents a sentence as a set of words or sequence of words (bag) and their frequency of occurence in the sentence. Most common approach is to split the sentences into single words and their individual count in the sentence.The individual words are called unigrams. For example:\n",

      " The last business trip  I drove to San Francisco  I went to Hertz Rentals and got a 1999 Ford Taurus  thinking it looked comfortable and professional  I found the seating to be uncomfortable for myself  as well as for my passenger Now  seating comfort may not be important to you  but it is to me The fuel usage was fine  the car did get us there with no problems  but  it was such an uncomfortable ride for both of us  It is not as though I am hard to fit into a car  I am 5 5  weigh 115 pounds  and I am usually quite comfortable in most any car  But  the Taurus seemed especially uncomfortable  For anyone who is thinking of renting a car for a long trip  I would suggest that the Ford Taurus  1999  not be on the list of  be sure to get this There was a large trunk that allowed us to pack a lot of materials needed for the business end of the trip  Driving it was a breeze  and everything  worked  right  I have no complaints about the standard making of the car  except in the comfort area  How important is comfort to you  On a long trip  being an uncomfortable driver is distracting to me  and it made the trip seem unnecessarily longer than it should have felt  I make this trip a lot  The Saturn would have been a better choice for me  as I have rented this model quite often  It offers comforts that the Taurus simply does not have If you are planning a long trip  or to buy a car that you intend to be comfortably seated in  check out the Taurus on a longer trial basis than you might another car  You may find the same thing happening to your comfort  \n",

      " My husband and I purchased a 1990 Ford F250 and had nothing but problems  we have owned the vehicle approximately two years and it has spent at least half of that time in the shop The first problem was the valve covers were leaking  This problem took three days in the shop  When we went to pick it up  we found that the mechanic at the dealership did not replace parts that he had to take off  This took an additional week  Because of the poor design  fixing this vehicle was not found to be cheap  nor could just any mechanic do the work Next   within one week  the serpentine belt came off the pulleys and sheared off the air conditioning power plug  This also took nearly a week to fix  Cause of this problem was unknown Next  the clean air pump broke  again within a week  This took about four days to fix  When I picked up the truck after the air pump  I didn t realize at the time that the mechanic had not hooked back up a hose to the transmission  So  after driving it for three days  my transmission needed to be rebuilt  Due to unavailable parts  a new transmission replaced the old  Which was mated to a junk yard transfer case  This repair took about 5 days Truck vibrates at about 70 miles an hour  so we spent  1700  on a new front end  tires  balancing etc  This did not help the situation Within two weeks the serpentine belt was replaced for the second time since I bought the vehicle  The truck had 98 000 miles when I took over so I expected some problems don t get me wrong  but newer vehicles are said too have 200 000 mile motor s I noticed a large loss of power after said repairs  then began the costly fixes and diagnostics to find cause of power loss  The gas mileage at this point is about 10mpg never increasing the belt replacement continued till the present date at a belt every month  The truck went into the shop again for transmission leaks to a ford dealership where the problems found mounted  Once again unavailable and discontinued parts This is not even close to being all of the problems  but I think I ve said enough     \n",

      " I feel I have a thorough opinion of this truck compared to most who post evaluations of their vehicles  My truck has been owned by me since new and currently have 75k miles  I ve been meticulous with maintenance and treating my truck with normal duty activities  never exceeding the manufacturer s recommendations This is information regarding my vehicle and the excessive amount of problems found during an inspection 15 Sept 2003  It s reference for anyone else who has had the same problems or looking for information regarding warranties and extended warranties  You are welcome to give some feedback  VEHICLE  2000 FORD F150 5 4L 4x4 XLT w  Off Road   Tow Package 17  Rims  Everything factory install  all the top options included  EXTENDED WARRANTY  Purchased FORD s version 75K mile Bumper to Bumper coverage when new  50 deductible per drive in occurrence  DRIVING CONDITIONS  Never taken off road  Never towed anything of significant weight and Never used inappropriately Toward the last 400 miles of my 75K mile Ford purchased extended warranty bumper to bumper plan  the passenger side power door lock failed and the ABS light turned on  I brought it in to the dealer for an inspection along with some squeeking of the front end  thought it was a tire rim leak  PROBLEMS FOUND 1  All 4 tie rods  inners and outers  bad 2  Lower ball joints  bad 3  ABS Codes C1095 and C1096  ECU and HCU Controller and Module Assembly  bad 4  Passenger side door lock actuator  bad 5  Power Steering Pump  bad  air conditioning warranty replaced back at 30k miles  All items above were replaced under the purchased extended warranty bumber to bumber plan  EXCEPT a kit for the module assembly on the ABS  I will dispute that today  but had to pay for it to get it done  I am shocked that this much damage was found for a vehicle at only 75k miles proclaimed to be  Built Ford Tough  yet only offering a 36K mile manufacturer warranty  If I did not have the extended warranty  I could only guess the bill to pay for this The extended cab seating is extremely cramped  My friends refuse to be a passenger in the back  The rear bench seating is hard  very uncomfortable  General Motors seems to have very comfortable and roomy seating in their comparable models  The ignition is hidden and difficult to find  The stereo is second class for sound and tuning stations  especially AM  Factory installed tires have no significant grip traction after 10 000 miles  I recommend getting a spray in liner to help prevent the large dents and scratches that have happened in my truck  but not trucks that have been sprayed  The metal can t hold up and appears thin for the bed I do like the exterior look of the F150  The height is fantastic  I can see all around while driving  it certainly upsets small vehicle drivers behind me  tailgating me and assuming I m a slow road hog in the left lane  but when trying to pass  they see the road jammed full of cars in front of me  bumper to bumper  Accelerations and towing torque are very good  Although now I sense a loss or hesitation on a occasions when I have to suddenly put the petal to the medal to avoid accidents Expect to pay the value of your truck in maintenance costs from the dealer  They make their money on repairs and maintenance  very expensive  I m not complaining about this  but you buy and expensive truck  expect to pay for the maintenance  \n",

      " AS a mother of 3  all of whom are still in carseats  the only logical thing to do was to trade in my 200sx for a minivan  As the minivan is only one of a handful of vehicles that have the room my family requires  In addition  We bought a new one so the mechanical difficulties would be minimum I love the fact that the van seats so many people  I never have to worry about bringing 2 cars  Even if I have me kids with me the van seats added passengers  It does so in a roomy way as well I like the way the Windstar handles  It has great acceleration  I like the fact that you are able to see way infront of you while driving  But these features are almost always indicative of all vans  or at least most of them I hate the fact that this vehicle has broken down 4 times leaving myself and my children STRANDED on the side of the road  Each time we brought it back to the dealer where they said they fixed it  Each diagnosis was different  The engine lights continues to go on  to this day  This makes it difficult if not impossible for me to feel safe in the Windstar  Thankfully  my husband is quite mechanical The Windstar handles well  It is easy to steer and control  much like driving a car  Some vans have steering that is difficult The suspension on the Windstar leaves something to be desired  I have the privledge of feeling every bump The brakes are sound  I have yet to have them fail or squeak severly People who should buy this vehicle are those with alot of children or who need to transport alot of things  Anyone who enjoys sports cars   fast vehicles  should avoid this car \n",

    "In Task1, we represented only the presence or absence of the positive and negative words in the review. This approach works well when the review contains purely positive or purely negative words. However, classifying reviews which contain an equal or almost equal number of positive and negative words requires an understanding of the context they are used in the sentence[2]. For instance using unigrams on the following text:   \n",
    "<br>\n",
    "\"I'm not happy and I don’t like it!\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "the words \"happy\" and \"like\" will be counted as positive[2]\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "Therefore, pair of words like \"not happy\" and \" don't like\" show that the meaning or context of words matters along with their presence in the text. By using n-grams, more specifically bigrams we can capture pairs of consecutive words which contain polarity missed by the unigrams.\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "In Task 2, we will be using unigrams and bigram features to train the Multinomial Naive Bayes Classifier. Previous observations show that using only bigrams has very small improvements or even decrease performance and therefore, extending unigrams instead of completely replacing with bigrams would be a better approach[3]. The use of unigrams and bigrams showed improvement in accuracy of classification when compared to unigrams even though the increase may not be very high [3][4][5].   \n",
    "<br>\n",
    "Use of trigrams or higher n grams may not improve the classifier significantly. As n increases, feature vectors will contain a lot of irrelevant features or noise. For instance,\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "\"The Ford SUV we bought is really spacious\" \n",
    "<br>\n",
    "\"The Ford SUV\",\"Ford SUV we\",\"SUV we bought\",\"we bought is\",\"bought is really\", \"is really spacious\"\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "features like \"The Ford SUV\", \"Ford SUV we\", \"SUV we bought\", \"we bought is\" contribute very less to the sentiment of the review and the frequency of their occurence in the train and test set will be very low [6].The contribution of these higher n-grams will be insignificant when compared to the contributions of unigrams.Therefore, we will ignore ngrams with n>2.\n",

    "The overall accuracy of the classifier in Task2 is 80% when compared to the Task1 where it was 77%. Therefore, the inclusion of bigrams in the features did show a minor improvement for this particular random state.The increase in the accuracy of the classifier might change depending upon the random state chosen to split the data.\n",

    "\n",
    "Comparing the confusion matrices, we can see that in Task2, the number of True positives has increased by 5% and the number of False negatives has decreased by 4.5%. It can be seen that reviews with overall positive sentiment but with a lot of negative words, have been classified correctly as positive in Task2 which reduces the number of false negatives. For instance, reviews like \"I do not mind paying a high price and do not mind the bad tyres\" has more negative words but the overall sentiment is positive. Hence unigrams+bigrams, for this random state have reduced the number of false negatives.\n",
    "<br>\n",

    "However, the number of False positives has increased by 2%. It can be seen that the reviews with overall negative sentiment but with a lot of positive words have not been classified correctly as negative.Also,the number of True negatives have decreased by 1%. Overall, incorporating unigrams+bigrams for this state has caused more number of negative sentiments to be classified incorrectly.  "
